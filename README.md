# Police_Stop_EDA

Performed an experiment to determine if a pattern between race and length of a police stop exists. Captured three datasets from the RIPA (Racial and Identity Profiling Act) police stop data. Stop detail data array: (464,044 x 29); race of persons (535,215 x 3), and result of stops (573,314 x 6). Performed exploratory data analysis against data sets using K-Means and the Gaussian Mixture Model clustering algorithms. Outcome: discovered the K-Means method produced uneven results because the data did not lend itself to uniform and/or circular clusters. Discovered the Gaussian Mixture Model eventually segmented the data by length of stop duration (short, medium, and long).  Performed subsequent experiments attempting to surface any categorical variables affected the duration of the stop by the officer using the ANOVA statistical method. Discovered the stop durations were NOT equal across all recorded races (p=9.38e-4 < 0.05), among other variables.
